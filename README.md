# MusicDiskPlayer

This library provides a rotated circle music player view. You could customize the

vary variables by yourself.

Let's see the result is faster than I explain. :)

# Demo

![MusicDiskPlayer](https://github.com/pokk/MusicDiskPlayer/raw/master/gif/music_disk_player.gif)

# How to use

The simplest way is as below:

```xml
<com.devrapid.musicdiskplayer.RotatedCircleWithIconImageView
    android:id="@+id/rotatedCircleImageView"
    android:layout_width="200dp"
    android:layout_height="200dp"
    app:src="@drawable/sample_lady_gaga"/>
```

The img source is a necessary parameter; otherwise, it won't work.

The parameters of this player view are allowed to control as below:

```xml
<com.devrapid.musicdiskplayer.RotatedCircleWithIconImageView
    android:id="@+id/rotatedCircleImageView"
    android:layout_width="200dp"
    android:layout_height="200dp"
    app:src="@drawable/sample_lady_gaga"
    app:progress_color="#2D3BFF"
    app:unprogress_color="#AFE2FF"
    app:progress_width="15"
    app:progress="40"
    app:controller_radius="20"
    app:controller_color="#9F9F9F"
    app:unpress_controller_color="#FFFFFF"
    app:end_time="120"
    app:fore_icon="@drawable/play_icon"
    app:running_icon="@drawable/pause_icon"
    app:time_label="true"/>
```

#### The description of the variables.

- progress_width: the width of the progress bar.
- progress: current progress percent. The range is between `0 ~ 100`.
- controller_radius: the radius of the progress controller.
- end_time: due to `progress` is according to `end time`, this should be set together with `progress`. Unit is `Second`.
- fore_icon: the icon will appear when the player is `stop` state.
- running_icon: the icon will appear when the player is `running` state.
- time_label: `true` â†’ show the time label; `false` â†’ hide the time label.

This is also allowed change by programming! ðŸ˜„
